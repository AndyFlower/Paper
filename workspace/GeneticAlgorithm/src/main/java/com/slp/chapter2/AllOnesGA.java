/**
 * This is our main class used to run the genetic algorithm.
 * 
 * This case is one of the simplest problems we can solve: the objective is to
 * end up with an individual whose chromosome is all ones.
 * 
 * The simplicity of this problem makes the GeneticAlgorithm class'
 * "calcFitness" method very simple. We'll just count the number of ones in the
 * chromosome and use that as the fitness score. Similarly, the
 * "isTerminationConditionMet" method in the GeneticAlgorithm class for this
 * example is very simple: if the fitness score (ie, number of ones) is the same
 * as the length of the chromosome (ie, we're all ones), we're done!
